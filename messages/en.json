        "second_text": "Founded by Alberto Borrás, it is more than just a student service agency. It is a project designed to ensure personalized and exclusive attention for young newcomers to Valencia, ensuring that their experience is smooth, safe, and tailored to their needs. <br /> <br /> The inspiration for (strong)helloflatmate(/strong) arose while Alberto was living in Bristol (England), specifically when he was moving to London. <br /> <br /> Loaded with more luggage than he could handle, without accommodation booked because he didn't trust it, he began to dream of a service that would make arriving in an unfamiliar place easier. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine someone waiting for us upon arrival in London, helping us with our bags, paperwork, and guiding us in those first days? Alberto recalls thinking. <br /> <br /> That idea evolved into a comprehensive solution for international and national students looking for accommodation in Valencia. <br /> <br /> The goal was not only to find a place to live but to provide real support at every step of the process, from arrival to integration. <br /> <br /> Although Alberto insists he was not the first to offer rooms for students in the world, he is clear that (strong)helloflatmate(/strong) was a pioneer in prioritizing the adaptation of young people and their peace of mind, offering much more than just accommodation. The key lies in the small details: support with administrative tasks, local recommendations, and a close service that creates a positive impact on students' lives. <br /> <br /> Regarding the future, Alberto and his team are optimistic, although they prefer to focus on the present and continue providing quality service. 'Every day is full of challenges, but the gratitude from families and students is what drives us to keep going,' he states.",
